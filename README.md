## RDuino

This package will serve as an interface between R and Arduino, allowing you to read and write to your board without having to go through sketch!
After creating this interface, we plan to carry out a series of stimulating examples to showcase the product we have created and possible uses it lends itself to.

This is an open source project based out of Dr. Peter Hoff's lab at Duke University.
